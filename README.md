# MITIG&TE (Under development)
MITIG&TE automatically enumerates Windows settings in order to identify MITRE ATT&CK techniques that are mitigated due to configuration hardening and existing endpoint controls. It heavily relies on the amazing work of the MITRE ATT&CK team and the mitigations defined for each of the techniques. 

## Goals

Over the past couple of years the MITRE ATT&CK framework has been widely adopted by security teams. This tool allows security teams to easily account and track the impact of endpoint configuration hardening and controls have against their threat profile. Use MITIG&TE to:
 - Identify techniques that are currently mitigated/less likely to be executed successfully.
 - Combine with threat intelligence and your existing blue teaming capabilities to get a holistic view of you security posture mapped against ATT&CK

## Quick Start
Not released yet


## Let's make MITIG&TE a reality 
Currently MITIG&TE is under development and only covers a small number of ATT&CK techniques. I will be gradually expanding coverage (as availability allows). If you would like to contribute please contact me. 

## Disclaimer
I am not a software development so I apologise in advance for the state of the code. Hopefully, I will be able to focus a bit more on my code cleanliness and add more comments in the future.
